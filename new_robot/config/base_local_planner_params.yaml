TrajectoryPlannerROS:

  holonomic_robot: false

  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.05      # The tolerance in radians for the controller in yaw/rotation when achieving its goal default 0.05 radians
  xy_goal_tolerance : 0.05      # The tolerance in meters for the controller in the x & y distance when achieving a goal default 0.1 meters
  latch_xy_goal_tolerance: false # (bool, default: false) If goal tolerance is latched, if the robot ever reaches the goal xy location it will simply rotate in place, even if it ends up outside the goal tolerance while it is doing so. 
  sim_time: 3.0                 # default 1.0 seconds
  meter_scoring: true          # scoring in meters rather than cells default false
  pdist_scale: 0.8              # The weighting for how much the controller should stay close to the path it was given default 0.6
  gdist_scale: 1.0              # The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to reach its local goal, also controls speed default 0.8
  publish_cost_grid_pc: false   # (bool, default false) Whether or not to publish the cost grid that the planner will use when planning. 
  oscillation_reset_dist: 0.1   # (double, default 0.05) How far the robot must travel in meters before oscillation flags are reset
  escape_vel: -0.1              # (double, default -0.1) Speed used for driving during escapes in meters/sec. Note that it must be negative in order for the robot to actually reverse.
  heading_scoring_timestep: 0.8 # (double, default: 0.8) How far to look ahead in time in seconds along the simulated trajectory when using heading scoring
