# Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Project
## Term2 Localization Lab

## Abstract
The two robots are created in the project, these two robots both should utilize ROS packages to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a provided map in the Gazebo and RViz simulation environments. The sensors and AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization) algorithm are used to locate current position, and search the path to navigate to predefined target position automatically. The results for both the Classroom robot and the developed robot will be compared in this article.

## Introduction
The project forcus on following several aspects of robotics:
* Building a mobile robot for simulated tasks.
* Creating a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a Gazebo world and utilizes packages like AMCL and the Navigation Stack.
* Exploring, adding, and tuning specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results.

The project created two robots: one is benchmark robot given as part of the project, the second one was created by auther.
Both robots need to use sensors such as a camera or Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) and AMCL algorithm package. 
A predefined maze map was provided, a C++ navigation goal program was coded to give a navugation goal position.
